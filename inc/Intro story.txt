The year 2432, 7 years after world war 17.
Rampant consumism and centuries of war have finally emptied the last rescorces of the dying earth. 
The only hope for mans further survival is out among the stars, where space-based miners harvest asteroids; a horrific and often deadly process.
As one of many war veterans your last chanse to survive is the astro-mining buisness. Good luck... you'll need it.
